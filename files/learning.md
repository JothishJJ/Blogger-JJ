As a **programmer** I think you **learn quite a lot** throughout your career at least this is what I heard from the YouTube videos so learning is pretty important as a programmer.

There are many times as a programmer you might learn new things like when you want to

- Implement that new feature
- Understanding more about the framework you're using
- Learning a new framework

---

So it is pretty important that you have the ability to learn and as a programmer you will never **enough**.

But if you're a programmer you might have heard that creating a blog will improve your programming skills. That is why I created this blog as well I hope that I can improve my programming skills by making this blog and hope to make a lot of blogs in the future.
